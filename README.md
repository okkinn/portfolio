## Developer Info
Hello! I'm Nico, a third year computer science student at the University of the Philippines Los Baños. I’m deeply interested in AI and Data Science because of the profound impact they have on the world and would like to pursue a career in these fields.

When I’m away from the keyboard, I like to read a wide range of genres such as Self-help, Philosophy, and Programming books. I also workout and play volleyball as part of the varsity team.
